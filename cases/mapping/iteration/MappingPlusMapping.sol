/**
  Use case: We need to know if a given value, for a given key, is present within any struct that is contained within a mapping.

  Say we have a mapping that holds structs. What the structs hold is largely irrevalent here,
  (though there may be a case where we want to test the if the size of the struct matters)
  what we are interested in is an "owner" attribute which holds an Adress. The presence of a given adress in any
  struct within this mapping means that the given address is an "owner" of whatever this mapping holds.

  For this example we'll cite that magnum-opus dissertation of socioeconomic status meets price-of-fame meets fleeting-nature-of-success masterwork:
  Get Him to the Greek:
    "I own 20 Koo Koo Roos."

                "21 sir..."

    "I own 21 Koo Koo Roos. Y'all don't own one Koo Koo Roo. Not one..."


  NOTE: A second constraint is important here. It is a *known law* that no one may own more than 20 Koo Koo Roos unless they are
  Sean Combs. In this solution we enforce the upper bound by simply using an integer as the value for the "owner" mapping.
